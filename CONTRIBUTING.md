# Contributing

This is my personal side project created just for kicks, but purposly developed out in the open. No one would be happier than me if someone actually took some time and improve this project in their own special way. All contributions are welcome, no matter how small or big.

-----

Fork, then clone the repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:your-username/xkcd-excuse-front.git
```

Nothing fancy here, just open `index.html` and make some changes.

Push to your fork and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/mislavcimpersak/xkcd-excuse-front/compare/).

I'll try to review your changes as soon as possible and hopefuly merge them.
